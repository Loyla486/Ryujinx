# Ryujinx-Spacemeowx2-Ldn

A port of [ldn_mitm](https://github.com/spacemeowx2/ldn_mitm) to [Ryujinx](https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx) (LDN build)

## Notes

I started working on this with the older version of the LDN build and ported my changes to the new version.

**Dependency update**: NetCoreServer was updated to 5.1.0 in the process, so I was able to properly customize the servers and clients.

I have no idea if the code style is correct, but please tell me to fix it if it's not.

## TODOs

- Clean up code
- Submit PR
