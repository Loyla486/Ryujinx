# Ryujinx-Spacemeowx2-Ldn

A port of [ldn_mitm](https://github.com/spacemeowx2/ldn_mitm) to [Ryujinx](https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx) (LDN build)

## Notes

I started working on this with the older version of the LDN build and ported my changes to the new version.

Also I keep my build up to date with master, since LDN is a lot more stable this way.
This might cause some issues with the current public LDN build, since the latest master changes don't get merged into the public version.

**Dependency update**: NetCoreServer was updated to 5.1.0 in the process, so I was able to properly customize the servers and clients.

I have no idea if the code style is correct, but please tell me to fix it if it's not.
As soon as I get the message that you would like to merge this, I will clean it up and make changes to comply with c# coding conventions.
